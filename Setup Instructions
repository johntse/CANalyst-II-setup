for those who has come to this page because the CANalyst-II hardware is unable to work due to driver issues 
i have found the correct solution that do not require any third party driver

note: the CANalyst-II are clones and not an original product from ZLG
To get the CANalyst-II to work, forget all supplied documentation, do the following

MOST IMPORTANT, MAY HAVE TO DISABLE CERTIFICATE SIGNING IN ORDER FOR THE DRIVER TO BE PROPERLY INSTALLED
do not skip this step, or else the CANalyst-II hardware will not be detected at all

1) install USB_CAN TOOL - this is the software that works with USB-CAN(U) or USB-CAN(C)
   this software can work with CANalyst-II off the shelf
2) install CANTEST and CANPRO, both from ZLG website
   this software can only work with the original CANalyst-II+ but not with CANalyst-II clones
3) copy the ControlCAN.DLL from USB_CAN TOOL and overwrite the one in both CANTEST and CANPRO
   Voila, now both CANTEST and CANPRO can work with the Canalyst-II clones in USNCAN, USBCAN2, USBCAN-E-U and USBCAN-2E-U
4) you can verify that it is working by the CAN PORT1 & 2 BLUE LED blinked
